# OpenRouter API Authentication Troubleshooting

## Current Issue
The Masterful Cognitive Processor is encountering an authentication error when attempting to connect to OpenRouter API:
```
OpenRouter API Authentication Error: 401 - {"error":{"message":"No auth credentials found","code":401}}
```

## Diagnosis
We've ruled out code-related issues through multiple tests and improvements to the API handling logic. The API key is being properly loaded from the environment variables and correctly formatted in the Authorization header, but OpenRouter is not recognizing it as valid.

## Possible Solutions

1. **Verify Your OpenRouter Account Status**
   - Visit https://openrouter.ai/keys to check if your account is active and has sufficient credits
   - Check if there are any account notifications or limitations

2. **Generate a New API Key**
   - Your current key might have been revoked, expired, or deactivated
   - Generate a new API key through the OpenRouter dashboard
   - Replace the key in your `.env` file: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_new_key_here`

3. **Check for API Changes**
   - OpenRouter might have updated their API requirements
   - Visit their documentation to verify if any additional headers or parameters are required: https://openrouter.ai/docs

4. **Verify API Rate Limits**
   - Ensure you haven't exceeded your OpenRouter API rate limits
   - Some plans have usage restrictions that can lead to authentication failures

## How to Test Your API Key

You can test your OpenRouter API key directly using the `test-openrouter-direct.js` script:

```
node test-openrouter-direct.js
```

## Code Changes Made

We've already implemented the following improvements to the codebase:

1. Enhanced the API key validation in GeminiService
2. Added detailed error reporting for authentication issues
3. Improved the environment variable loading and validation
4. Fixed potential service instantiation issues

These changes ensure that once you have a valid API key, the system will work correctly.
