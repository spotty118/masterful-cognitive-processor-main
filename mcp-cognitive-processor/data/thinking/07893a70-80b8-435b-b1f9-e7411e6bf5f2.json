  "problem": "Conduct a detailed review of the mcp-cognitive-processor codebase, excluding caching and storage mechanisms. Identify potential enhancements focusing on: 1) Code Structure: Suggest improvements for better organization, modularity, and readability. 2) Efficiency: Analyze for performance bottlenecks and suggest optimizations. 3) Error Handling: Review error handling strategies and suggest improvements for robustness. 4) Extensibility: Evaluate the current design for extensibility and suggest patterns or practices to enhance it. The review should provide an overview of potential enhancements without making any code modifications.",
