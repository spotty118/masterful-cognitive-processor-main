  "problem": "Provide an extremely detailed and complete overview of potential enhancements for the `mcp-cognitive-processor` project, without implementing any code modifications. Focus on these seven areas:\n\n1. **Code Structure and Modularity**: Conduct an in-depth evaluation of the project's code structure. Propose specific improvements for enhanced modularity, clearer separation of concerns, and better overall organization. Analyze directory structure, module boundaries, and dependency management, suggesting concrete refactoring steps.\n\n2. **Performance Optimization**: Perform a thorough investigation of potential performance bottlenecks within the codebase. Identify precise areas where targeted optimizations could yield significant gains in efficiency, measurable reductions in latency, or substantial lowering of resource consumption. Delve into caching strategies, algorithmic efficiency of critical sections, and asynchronous processing capabilities, recommending specific optimization techniques.\n\n3. **Readability and Maintainability**: Conduct a detailed assessment of the codebase's readability and maintainability. Put forward actionable refactoring strategies to enhance code clarity, simplify demonstrably complex logic, rigorously minimize code duplication, and comprehensively ensure adherence to established coding standards. Focus on granular aspects such as naming conventions, the thoroughness and clarity of code commenting practices, and the systematic organization of code blocks and files.\n\n4. **Error Handling and Robustness**: Perform a critical scrutiny of the existing error handling mechanisms. Recommend concrete enhancements to robustly bolster system resilience, significantly improve error reporting granularity and clarity, and effectively facilitate rapid recovery from diverse failure scenarios. Deeply examine exception handling strategies, input validation rigor, logging effectiveness and detail, and fault tolerance capabilities across different system components.\n\n5. **Extensibility and Flexibility**: Conduct an exhaustive analysis of the codebase's design concerning extensibility and flexibility. Suggest well-defined architectural or design pattern improvements that would tangibly enable the easier addition of genuinely new features, seamless adaptability to realistically evolving requirements, and truly frictionless integration with genuinely external systems. Critically consider the strategic and tactical use of interfaces, abstract classes, and plugin-based architectures, providing specific examples of how these could be applied.\n\n6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Rigorously examine the current testing strategy and infrastructure. Propose measurable improvements to demonstrably strengthen code quality assurance and overall reliability. Critically evaluate the scope, depth, and effectiveness of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, as well as quantifiable test coverage metrics and the appropriateness of utilized testing frameworks, suggesting specific enhancements to testing practices.\n\n7. **Documentation and Developer Experience**: Comprehensively evaluate the quality, completeness, accuracy, and accessibility of the codebase's documentation. Suggest targeted enhancements to substantially improve developer understanding, significantly ease of use for new developers, and materially increase contribution potential from the wider development community. Focus on API documentation completeness and clarity, architectural documentation accuracy and depth, and developer guides' usefulness and relevance.\n\nEnsure the overview is extremely detailed and complete, providing actionable and specific suggestions for each of the seven areas. Do not make any code modifications.",
