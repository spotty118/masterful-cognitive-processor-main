Provide an overview of potential enhancements, focusing on performance, maintainability, and extensibility. Do not consider memory, cache, or storage. Consider the core components, service implementations, and factory patterns used in the codebase. Suggest improvements to the overall architecture, code structure, and specific algorithms. Focus on the files: src/index.ts, src/main.ts, src/core/ThinkingEngine.ts, src/services/ConfigurationService.ts, and src/factories/ServiceFactory.ts",
