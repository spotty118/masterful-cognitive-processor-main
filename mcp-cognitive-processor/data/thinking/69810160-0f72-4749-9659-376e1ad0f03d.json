  "problem": "Perform an in-depth code review of the mcp-cognitive-processor project, concentrating on the 'src/services' and 'src/core' directories. Analyze the codebase for potential improvements across several dimensions:\n\n1. **Optimization**: Identify performance bottlenecks, areas of resource inefficiency, and opportunities for algorithmic enhancement. Consider caching mechanisms, asynchronous processing, and data structure optimizations. Specific services to examine include CachingService, ProcessingService, and ModelFallbackService.\n\n2. **Refactoring**: Pinpoint code duplication, overly complex logic, and design weaknesses. Propose refactoring strategies to improve code clarity, maintainability, and modularity. Evaluate the application of design patterns and principles of SOLID. Key areas are within ThinkingEngine, StrategySelector, and ProcessingPipelineOrchestrator.\n\n3. **New Features**: Explore possibilities for extending the cognitive processor's capabilities. This could involve introducing new reasoning strategies, enhancing error handling and resilience, improving monitoring and logging for better observability, or integrating with additional AI services or data sources to broaden its functionality. Consider enhancements to the ThinkingServiceImpl and related service interfaces.\n\nTools available for this review include:\n- Implicitly: Code analysis capabilities within the cognitive processor itself.\n- list_code_definition_names: To understand the structure and components of the codebase.\n- read_file: To examine the detailed implementation of specific modules and functions.\n- search_files: To find code patterns, dependencies, and areas of interest across the codebase.\n\nThe goal is to deliver a comprehensive overview of potential enhancements, categorized by optimization, refactoring, and new features, without making any direct code modifications. Focus on actionable insights and specific recommendations for improving the mcp-cognitive-processor.",
