  "problem": "Conduct an exhaustive review of the `mcp-cognitive-processor` codebase to pinpoint potential areas for enhancement. Your review should specifically address the following aspects:\n\n1. **Code Structure and Modularity**: Evaluate the current project structure. Suggest improvements for enhanced modularity, clearer separation of concerns, and better organization. Analyze directory structure, module boundaries, and dependency management.\n\n2. **Performance Optimization**: Investigate potential performance bottlenecks within the codebase. Identify areas where optimizations could lead to significant improvements in efficiency, latency reduction, or resource utilization. Focus on caching strategies, algorithmic efficiency, and asynchronous processing opportunities.\n\n3. **Readability and Maintainability**: Assess the codebase's readability and maintainability. Propose refactoring strategies to improve code clarity, simplify complex logic, minimize code duplication, and ensure adherence to established coding standards. Pay close attention to naming conventions, code commenting practices, and overall code organization.\n\n4. **Error Handling and Robustness**: Scrutinize the existing error handling mechanisms. Recommend enhancements to bolster system robustness, improve error reporting, and facilitate recovery from failures. Examine exception handling, input validation, logging effectiveness, and fault tolerance.\n\n5. **Extensibility and Flexibility**: Analyze the codebase's design with respect to extensibility and flexibility. Suggest architectural or design pattern improvements that would enable easier addition of new features, adaptability to evolving requirements, and seamless integration with external systems. Consider the strategic use of interfaces, abstract classes, and plugin-based architectures.\n\n6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Examine the current testing strategy and infrastructure. Propose improvements to strengthen code quality assurance and reliability. Evaluate the scope and effectiveness of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, as well as test coverage and the utilization of testing frameworks.\n\n7. **Documentation and Developer Experience**: Evaluate the quality, completeness, and accessibility of the codebase's documentation. Suggest enhancements to improve developer understanding, ease of use, and contribution potential. Focus on API documentation, architectural documentation, and developer guides.\n\nFor each of these seven areas, deliver concrete, actionable recommendations for improvement. Utilize tools such as `list_files`, `list_code_definition_names`, and `read_file` as necessary to thoroughly explore the codebase and gather the information required for your analysis. The primary objective is to provide a highly detailed and comprehensive overview of potential enhancements for the `mcp-cognitive-processor` project, without implementing any code modifications.",
