  "problem": "Conduct a thorough and detailed code review of the `mcp-cognitive-processor` project, specifically excluding any aspects related to caching and storage mechanisms. This review should comprehensively identify potential enhancements across the following four critical areas:\n\n1.  **Code Structure and Organization**: Evaluate the current project structure, the division of modules, and the overall code organization. Suggest concrete improvements aimed at achieving better modularity, reducing inter-module coupling, and enhancing code readability. Consider recommending specific design patterns that could be effectively applied to improve the codebase's structure and maintainability.\n\n2.  **Computational Efficiency**: Perform a detailed analysis of the codebase to pinpoint potential performance bottlenecks and areas of computational inefficiency. Propose specific algorithmic optimizations or architectural adjustments that could lead to tangible improvements in processing speed and overall resource utilization.\n\n3.  **Error Handling and Robustness**: Critically review the existing error handling mechanisms throughout the codebase. Propose detailed enhancements for implementing more informative error reporting, developing more effective error propagation strategies, and significantly increasing the system's resilience to various types of failures.\n\n4.  **Extensibility and Maintainability**:  Assess the current design of the system with a focus on its extensibility and long-term maintainability. Suggest specific architectural patterns, the strategic use of interfaces, or coding best practices that could substantially improve the system's ability to seamlessly accommodate new features and significantly simplify future maintenance efforts. \n\nThe primary deliverable from this review is a comprehensive and detailed overview of all suggested enhancements across these four key areas. It is crucial that this review is conducted without implementing any actual code changes. The focus is solely on identification and recommendation of improvements.",
