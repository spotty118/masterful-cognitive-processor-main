  "problem": "Provide a highly detailed and comprehensive overview of potential enhancements for the `mcp-cognitive-processor` project, without implementing any code modifications. Focus on these seven areas:\n\n1. **Code Structure and Modularity**: Evaluate the current project structure and suggest improvements for enhanced modularity, clearer separation of concerns, and better organization. Analyze directory structure, module boundaries, and dependency management.\n\n2. **Performance Optimization**: Investigate potential performance bottlenecks within the codebase and identify areas for optimization to improve efficiency, reduce latency, or lower resource consumption. Consider caching strategies, algorithmic efficiency, and asynchronous processing.\n\n3. **Readability and Maintainability**: Assess the codebase's readability and maintainability. Propose refactoring strategies to enhance code clarity, simplify complex logic, minimize code duplication, and ensure adherence to coding standards. Focus on naming conventions, code commenting practices, and overall code organization.\n\n4. **Error Handling and Robustness**: Scrutinize the existing error handling mechanisms and recommend enhancements to bolster system robustness, improve error reporting, and facilitate recovery from failures. Examine exception handling, input validation, logging effectiveness, and fault tolerance.\n\n5. **Extensibility and Flexibility**: Analyze the codebase's design for extensibility and flexibility. Suggest architectural or design pattern improvements that would enable easier addition of new features, adaptability to evolving requirements, and seamless integration with external systems. Consider interfaces, abstract classes, and plugin-based architectures.\n\n6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Examine the current testing strategy and infrastructure. Propose improvements to strengthen code quality assurance and reliability. Evaluate unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, test coverage, and testing frameworks.\n\n7. **Documentation and Developer Experience**: Evaluate the quality, completeness, and accessibility of the codebase's documentation. Suggest enhancements to improve developer understanding, ease of use, and contribution potential. Focus on API documentation, architectural documentation, and developer guides.",
