  "problem": "Perform an in-depth code review of the mcp-cognitive-processor project, specifically excluding aspects related to caching and storage. The review should focus on identifying potential enhancements in the following areas:\n\n1. **Code Structure and Organization**: Assess the current project structure, module division, and code organization. Suggest improvements for better modularity, reduced coupling, and enhanced readability. Consider the use of design patterns to improve structure.\n2. **Computational Efficiency**: Analyze the codebase for potential performance bottlenecks and areas of inefficiency. Suggest algorithmic optimizations or architectural adjustments to improve processing speed and resource utilization.\n3. **Error Handling and Robustness**: Review the existing error handling mechanisms. Propose enhancements for more informative error reporting, better error propagation strategies, and increased system resilience to failures.\n4. **Extensibility and Maintainability**: Evaluate the current design for its extensibility and ease of maintenance. Suggest architectural patterns, interfaces, or coding practices that could improve the system's ability to accommodate new features and simplify future maintenance. \n\nThe outcome should be a detailed overview of suggested enhancements across these four areas, without implementing any code changes.",
