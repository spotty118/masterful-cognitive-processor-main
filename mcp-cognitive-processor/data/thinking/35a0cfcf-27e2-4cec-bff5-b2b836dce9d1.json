  "problem": "Conduct a detailed review of the `mcp-cognitive-processor` codebase to identify potential enhancements. Focus on these areas:\n1. **Code Structure and Modularity:** Analyze the current structure and suggest improvements for better modularity and separation of concerns. Use `list_files` and `list_code_definition_names` to understand the project structure and identify components.\n2. **Performance Optimization:** Identify potential performance bottlenecks and suggest optimizations. Look for areas where caching, efficient algorithms, or asynchronous operations could be beneficial. Analyze code in services and core directories.\n3. **Readability and Maintainability:** Review code for clarity, coding style consistency, and maintainability. Suggest refactoring opportunities to improve code readability and reduce complexity. Focus on areas with complex logic or long functions.\n4. **Error Handling and Robustness:** Examine error handling mechanisms and suggest improvements for better error reporting, recovery, and overall robustness. Check for unhandled exceptions or areas where error handling could be enhanced.\n5. **Potential New Features:** Based on the codebase and its purpose, suggest potential new features that could enhance its functionality or usability. Consider features related to extensibility, configuration, or integration with other systems.\n\nUse tools like `list_files`, `list_code_definition_names`, and `read_file` as needed to explore the codebase and gather information for your analysis. Do not make any code changes. Provide a structured overview of your findings and suggestions for each of the areas mentioned above.",
