  "problem": "Perform a comprehensive review of the `mcp-cognitive-processor` codebase to identify areas for enhancement, focusing on:\n\n1. **Code Structure and Modularity**: Assess the project's structure and suggest improvements for better organization, modularity, and separation of concerns. Consider the current directory structure, module boundaries, and dependency management.\n\n2. **Performance Optimization**: Analyze potential performance bottlenecks within the codebase. Identify areas where optimizations could lead to improved efficiency, reduced latency, or lower resource consumption. Consider aspects like caching mechanisms, algorithmic efficiency, and asynchronous processing.\n\n3. **Readability and Maintainability**: Evaluate the codebase for readability and maintainability. Suggest refactoring opportunities to enhance code clarity, simplify complex logic, reduce code duplication, and improve adherence to coding standards. Focus on naming conventions, code comments, and overall code organization.\n\n4. **Error Handling and Robustness**: Review the existing error handling strategies and suggest improvements for making the system more robust. Consider aspects like exception handling, input validation, logging, and fault tolerance.\n\n5. **Extensibility and Flexibility**: Assess the codebase's design for extensibility and flexibility. Suggest architectural or design pattern improvements that would make it easier to add new features, adapt to changing requirements, or integrate with other systems. Consider the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and plugin architectures.\n\n6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Examine the existing testing strategy and suggest improvements for ensuring code quality and reliability. Consider unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, as well as test coverage and testing frameworks.\n\n7. **Documentation and Developer Experience**: Evaluate the quality and completeness of the codebase's documentation. Suggest improvements to make it easier for developers to understand, use, and contribute to the project. Consider API documentation, architectural overviews, and developer guides.\n\nFor each of these areas, provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement. Use tools like `list_files`, `list_code_definition_names`, and `read_file` to explore the codebase as needed. The goal is to deliver a detailed overview of potential enhancements to the `mcp-cognitive-processor` project, without making any code modifications.",
