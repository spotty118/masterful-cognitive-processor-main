  "problem": "Conduct a comprehensive review of the mcp-cognitive-processor codebase, specifically focusing on the src/services and src/core directories. Analyze the architecture, design patterns, and implementation of services like CachingService, ProcessingPipelineOrchestrator, and ThinkingServiceImpl, as well as core components like ThinkingEngine and StrategySelector.\n\nIdentify potential enhancements in the following areas:\n\n* Optimization:  Look for performance bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, or areas where resource usage can be reduced. Consider caching strategies, asynchronous processing, and algorithmic improvements.\n* Refactoring: Identify areas with code duplication, complex logic, or design flaws that could benefit from refactoring. Suggest improvements to code structure, readability, and maintainability. Consider design pattern application and code modularization.\n* New Features: Explore opportunities to extend the functionality of the cognitive processor. Consider adding new reasoning strategies, improving error handling, enhancing monitoring and logging, or integrating with new AI services or data sources.\n\nUse available tools like list_code_definition_names, read_file, and search_files (implicitly through the cognitive processor) to understand the codebase. Do not make any code changes. The goal is to provide a detailed overview of potential enhancements for the mcp-cognitive-processor.",
