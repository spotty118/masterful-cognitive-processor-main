  "problem": "Conduct an exhaustive code review of the mcp-cognitive-processor project, with a primary focus on the 'src/services' and 'src/core' directories. The review should thoroughly analyze the codebase to identify concrete opportunities for enhancement across three key areas:\n\n1. **Optimization**: Deeply investigate performance bottlenecks within services like CachingService, ProcessingService, and ModelFallbackService. Identify specific inefficiencies in algorithms or resource utilization. Propose targeted optimization strategies, including but not limited to caching improvements, asynchronous processing techniques, algorithmic refinements, and data structure optimizations. Recommendations should be specific and actionable, detailing the 'what,' 'why,' and 'how' of each optimization.\n\n2. **Refactoring**: Critically assess the codebase for areas ripe for refactoring, particularly within core components such as ThinkingEngine, StrategySelector, and ProcessingPipelineOrchestrator. Pinpoint instances of code duplication, overly complex or convoluted logic, and design pattern violations. Develop detailed refactoring plans to enhance code clarity, modularity, and maintainability. Focus on applying SOLID principles and established design patterns to improve the architectural soundness of these components. Recommendations should include specific code examples or patterns to adopt.\n\n3. **New Features**: Innovatively explore opportunities to expand the cognitive processor's functionality. Brainstorm and propose new features that could significantly enhance its capabilities. This could encompass novel reasoning strategies, advanced error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms, comprehensive monitoring and logging solutions for enhanced observability, or seamless integrations with cutting-edge AI services or diverse data sources. For each proposed feature, outline its potential benefits, integration points, and a high-level implementation strategy. Focus on ThinkingServiceImpl and related interfaces for feature expansion.\n\nFor this comprehensive review, leverage the following tools to gain deep insights into the codebase:\n- Implicitly utilize the cognitive processor's inherent code analysis capabilities.\n- Employ 'list_code_definition_names' to grasp the project's structural organization and component relationships.\n- Utilize 'read_file' to meticulously examine the implementation details of critical modules and functions.\n- Leverage 'search_files' to efficiently locate code patterns, dependencies, and specific areas of interest throughout the codebase.\n\nThe ultimate objective is to deliver a meticulously detailed and structured report outlining potential enhancements for the mcp-cognitive-processor. This report should be rigorously categorized by Optimization, Refactoring, and New Features, providing not just observations but also actionable insights and concrete, specific recommendations for each area. The review must be conducted without making any direct code modifications, focusing solely on analysis and proposal generation.",
