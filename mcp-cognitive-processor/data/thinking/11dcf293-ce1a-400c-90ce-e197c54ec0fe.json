  "problem": "Execute a meticulous and comprehensive code review of the mcp-cognitive-processor project, with a laser focus on the 'src/services' and 'src/core' directories. This review demands an exhaustive analysis of the codebase to pinpoint tangible and impactful opportunities for enhancement across three pivotal dimensions:\n\n1. **Optimization**: Conduct an in-depth investigation to uncover performance bottlenecks within critical services such as CachingService, ProcessingService, and ModelFallbackService. Systematically identify specific areas of algorithmic inefficiency or suboptimal resource utilization. Formulate and propose highly targeted optimization strategies, encompassing but not limited to advanced caching techniques, asynchronous processing paradigms, algorithmic refinements grounded in performance analysis, and strategic data structure optimizations. Each optimization recommendation must be exceptionally specific and actionable, meticulously detailing the 'what' (the precise change), 'why' (the rationale and performance benefit), and 'how' (a high-level implementation approach) of the proposed improvement.\n\n2. **Refactoring**: Undertake a critical and rigorous assessment of the codebase to identify prime candidates for refactoring, with a particular emphasis on core components like ThinkingEngine, StrategySelector, and ProcessingPipelineOrchestrator. Precisely pinpoint instances of code duplication, areas exhibiting excessively complex or convoluted logic flows, and potential violations of established design patterns or SOLID principles. Develop comprehensive and actionable refactoring plans designed to substantially enhance code clarity, modularity, and long-term maintainability. Prioritize the strategic application of SOLID principles and well-established design patterns to fortify the architectural integrity and robustness of these core components. Refactoring recommendations should be exceptionally concrete, including specific code examples illustrating desired patterns or architectural improvements.\n\n3. **New Features**: Engage in an innovative and forward-thinking exploration of opportunities to significantly expand the cognitive processor's inherent functionality and broaden its application scope. Generate and rigorously evaluate proposals for novel features that promise to deliver substantial enhancements to its cognitive processing capabilities. This may encompass the introduction of cutting-edge reasoning strategies, the implementation of sophisticated error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms to bolster system resilience, the development of comprehensive monitoring and logging solutions to achieve superior observability and diagnostic capabilities, or the seamless integration with next-generation AI services or diverse, external data sources to enrich its information processing capacity. For each proposed new feature, meticulously outline its potential benefits in terms of enhanced functionality or expanded application domains, clearly define critical integration points within the existing architecture, and present a well-considered, high-level implementation strategy that addresses key technical challenges and dependencies. Special attention should be given to potential feature expansions within ThinkingServiceImpl and related service interfaces, as these are central to the processor's core cognitive functions.\n\nTo ensure the thoroughness and depth of this comprehensive review, strategically leverage the following suite of analytical tools to gain profound insights into the intricacies of the codebase:\n- Implicitly harness the cognitive processor's embedded code analysis capabilities to automatically identify potential issues and areas for improvement.\n- Systematically employ 'list_code_definition_names' to develop a comprehensive understanding of the project's structural organization, inter-component relationships, and high-level architectural design.\n- Diligently utilize 'read_file' to meticulously examine the detailed implementation of critical modules, algorithms, and functions, enabling a granular analysis of code logic and potential inefficiencies.\n- Expertly leverage 'search_files' to efficiently locate recurring code patterns, track dependencies across modules, and rapidly identify specific areas of interest or concern throughout the entirety of the codebase.\n\nThe paramount objective of this exhaustive code review is to deliver a meticulously detailed, rigorously structured, and exceptionally actionable report that comprehensively outlines potential enhancements for the mcp-cognitive-processor. This report must be rigorously categorized under the headings of Optimization, Refactoring, and New Features, ensuring a clear and systematic presentation of findings. Crucially, the report should not merely present high-level observations but must provide concrete, specific, and readily implementable recommendations for each identified area of improvement. The entire review process must be executed without making any direct modifications to the codebase, maintaining a strict focus on in-depth analysis, strategic proposal generation, and the delivery of actionable intelligence to guide future development efforts.",
