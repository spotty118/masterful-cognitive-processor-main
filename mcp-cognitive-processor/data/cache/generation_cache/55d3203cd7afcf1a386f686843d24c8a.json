Recommend specific techniques for optimizing the handling of large batches of tasks, reducing overall processing time, and improving resource utilization (CPU, memory). Consider techniques like parallel processing, efficient data serialization within batches, and batch size tuning.\\n\\n2. **Stream Handling**:  Elaborate on how to improve stream processing within the ProcessingService. Propose specific enhancements for achieving more efficient stream management, robust error handling within streaming operations, and effective backpressure management to prevent overload. Consider techniques like using asynchronous iterators efficiently, implementing circuit breaker patterns for stream error handling, and employing appropriate backpressure strategies.\\n\\n3. **Retry Mechanisms**:  Provide a detailed analysis of the current retry logic used in the ProcessingService. Suggest concrete improvements to the retry strategies to enhance robustness and efficiency. Recommend specific enhancements to retry policies (e.g., exponential backoff with jitter), backoff mechanisms, and error logging practices during retry attempts to improve system resilience and debuggability.\\n\\nFor each optimization recommendation, ensure that you clearly and concisely outline:\\n- **What**: Precisely define the specific optimization action to be implemented in the ProcessingService.\\n- **Why**: Articulate the clear and compelling performance or efficiency benefits that will result from implementing this optimization.\\n- **How**: Provide a brief, yet comprehensively actionable, step-by-step approach to effectively implement the recommended optimization within a TypeScript/Node.js development context.
