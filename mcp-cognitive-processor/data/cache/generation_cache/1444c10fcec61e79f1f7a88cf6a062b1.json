This diff should implement a layered architecture by separating reasoning system selection and step processing into distinct layers.

Refactor the `selectReasoningSystem` and `processProblem` methods to fully reflect these architectural changes. Ensure the diff includes all necessary interface definitions, class modifications, and any other code adjustments required for a complete and cohesive refactoring.
