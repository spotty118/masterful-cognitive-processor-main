This diff MUST be returned as plain text ONLY in the response, with ABSOLUTELY NO JSON or analysis or explanation. The diff should implement a robust layered architecture with clear separation of concerns: reasoning system selection, step processing, conclusion determination, and token optimization should be in distinct, well-defined layers. Fully incorporate dependency injection for all reasoning strategies, token optimizer, and intelligence service. Apply the strategy pattern rigorously for different reasoning strategies to ensure extensibility and maintainability. Refactor the `selectReasoningSystem`, `processProblem`, `shouldConclude`, and `processStepResponse` methods to comprehensively reflect these architectural changes. Ensure the diff includes all necessary interface definitions, abstract classes, concrete class modifications, updates to constructor dependencies, configuration adjustments, and any other code adjustments absolutely required for a complete, cohesive, and production-ready refactoring. The generated diff MUST be directly and seamlessly applicable to the `ThinkingEngine.ts` file without any manual adjustments whatsoever. The refactored code should be highly modular, testable, and maintainable, adhering to the highest best practices of layered architecture, dependency injection, and strategy pattern, and ready for production deployment. Please return ONLY the code diff in plain text format in the response. Ensure that the diff is complete and includes all necessary changes for a production-ready refactoring. The diff must be in unified format and MUST be returned as plain text. It is absolutely critical that the diff is complete and production-ready and returned as plain text diff. The diff should be in plain text unified format and nothing else. Return ONLY the plain text diff. I need ONLY the plain text diff in the response, nothing else. ABSOLUTELY NO JSON.
