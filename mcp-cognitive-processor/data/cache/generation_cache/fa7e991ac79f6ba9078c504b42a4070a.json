For larger caches, consider external solutions like Redis for better memory management and scalability.\\n2. **Eviction Policies:** Implement LRU eviction policy for most scenarios. For specific use-cases, allow configuration to switch to LFU or FIFO.\\n3. **Persistence Mechanisms:** Use asynchronous JSON serialization with `fs.promises` for persistence. For improved performance and integrity, explore binary formats like MessagePack or consider a lightweight database like SQLite.\\n\\n**ProcessingService Optimizations:**\\n1. **Batch Processing:** Implement parallel processing using `Promise.all` or worker threads for CPU-bound tasks. Optimize batch size dynamically based on system load and task complexity.\\n2. **Stream Handling:** Utilize asynchronous iterators and generators for efficient stream processing. Implement circuit breaker pattern for stream error handling and apply backpressure using `ReadableStream` and `WritableStream` APIs.\\n3. **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement exponential backoff with jitter for retry policies. Enhance error logging with correlation IDs and detailed context for debugging retry failures.\\n\\n**Refactoring Areas:**\\n- **StrategySelector:** Refactor `StrategySelector` to use a more extensible and maintainable strategy pattern, making it easier to add new thinking strategies without modifying core logic.\\n- **Service Interfaces:** Define clearer and more granular interfaces for services (like `IAIService`, `ICacheService`) to improve modularity and testability. Apply dependency inversion principle more consistently.\\n\\n**New Features:**\\n- **Adaptive Reasoning Strategies:** Implement a feature to dynamically adjust reasoning strategies based on problem complexity, domain, and real-time performance feedback.\\n- **Enhanced Monitoring and Logging:** Integrate a comprehensive monitoring and logging system using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track performance metrics, cache hit rates, and error occurrences for better observability.\\n\\nThis summary provides actionable insights and clear directions for development, focusing on optimization, refactoring, and new feature enhancements.\",\"selected_model\":\"standard\",\"estimated_tokens\":600,\"optimization_applied\":true,\"suggested_changes\":[],\"token_savings\":0,\"optimization_strategy\":\"\",\"domain\":\"technical\",\"concepts\":[]},\"memory_items_used\":5,\"cached\":false,\"internal_processing\":true}",
