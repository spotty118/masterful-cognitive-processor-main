This diff should implement a robust layered architecture by clearly separating reasoning system selection, step processing, and conclusion determination into distinct, well-defined layers. It must fully incorporate dependency injection for all reasoning strategies, the token optimizer, and any other relevant services. Apply the strategy pattern rigorously for different reasoning strategies to ensure extensibility and maintainability. Refactor the `selectReasoningSystem`, `processProblem`, `shouldConclude`, and `processStepResponse` methods to comprehensively reflect these architectural changes. Ensure the diff includes all necessary interface definitions, abstract classes, concrete class modifications, updates to constructor dependencies, and any other code adjustments absolutely required for a complete, cohesive, and production-ready refactoring. The generated diff must be directly and seamlessly applicable to the `ThinkingEngine.ts` file without any manual adjustments whatsoever. The refactored code should be highly modular, testable, and maintainable, adhering to the best practices of layered architecture, dependency injection, and strategy pattern.\"},\"memory_items_used\":5,\"cached\":false,\"internal_processing\":true}",
