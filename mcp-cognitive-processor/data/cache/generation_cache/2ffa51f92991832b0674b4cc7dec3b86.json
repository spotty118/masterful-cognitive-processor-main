This code should implement a robust layered architecture with clear separation of concerns: reasoning system selection, step processing, conclusion determination, and token optimization should be in distinct, well-defined layers. Fully incorporate dependency injection for all reasoning strategies, token optimizer, and intelligence service. Apply the strategy pattern rigorously for different reasoning strategies to ensure extensibility and maintainability. Refactor the `selectReasoningSystem`, `processProblem`, `shouldConclude`, and `processStepResponse` methods to comprehensively reflect these architectural changes. Ensure the code includes all necessary interface definitions, abstract classes, concrete class modifications, updates to constructor dependencies, configuration adjustments, and any other code adjustments absolutely required for a complete, cohesive, and production-ready refactoring. The generated code MUST be directly and seamlessly replace the existing `ThinkingEngine.ts` file content. The refactored code should be highly modular, testable, and maintainable, adhering to the highest best practices of layered architecture, dependency injection, and strategy pattern, and ready for production deployment.
